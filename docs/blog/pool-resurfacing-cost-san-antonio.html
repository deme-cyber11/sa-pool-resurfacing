<article class="blog-content">

  <p>If your San Antonio pool is looking rough, stained, or simply showing its age, you're probably wondering: <strong>what does pool resurfacing actually cost?</strong> The honest answer is that it depends — but we'll break down every factor so you can budget accurately and make a smart decision for your specific pool.</p>

  <p>Alamo Pool Resurfacing has completed over 1,200 pool resurfacing projects across Bexar County and the Texas Hill Country. We've seen every combination of pool size, surface condition, and finish material. This guide reflects what San Antonio homeowners actually pay in 2025 — not national averages that don't account for our local market, water conditions, or soil types.</p>

  <h2>Average Pool Resurfacing Cost in San Antonio</h2>

  <p>The average pool resurfacing project in San Antonio costs between <strong>$3,500 and $8,000</strong>, though larger pools with premium finishes and extensive crack repair can run $12,000–$15,000. Here's a breakdown by finish type for a standard 400–600 sq ft pool:</p>

  <table class="cost-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Finish Type</th>
        <th>Cost Range</th>
        <th>Lifespan (SA Conditions)</th>
        <th>Best For</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>White Plaster / Marcite</td>
        <td>$3,500 – $5,500</td>
        <td>8–12 years</td>
        <td>Budget-conscious, plan to sell</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Quartz Aggregate</td>
        <td>$5,000 – $8,500</td>
        <td>12–18 years</td>
        <td>Best value, hard water areas</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pebble (PebbleTec/PebbleSheen)</td>
        <td>$7,000 – $12,000</td>
        <td>15–25 years</td>
        <td>Long-term ownership, premium look</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

    <strong>💡 San Antonio Tip:</strong> Due to the Edwards Aquifer's hard water (calcium hardness 200–300+ mg/L), white plaster degrades faster here than in cities with softer water. Quartz and pebble finishes are generally better long-term investments for San Antonio homeowners.
  </div>

  <h2>Factors That Affect Pool Resurfacing Cost</h2>

  <p>The price you'll receive for your specific project depends on several variables beyond the finish type. Here's what drives cost up or down:</p>

  <h3>1. Pool Size</h3>
  <p>Larger pools require more materials and labor. Pool resurfacing is often priced by surface area (square footage of the interior). A small plunge pool might have 250 sq ft of surface; a large pool with spa, steps, and ledges might have 900+ sq ft. Be sure to get an estimate based on a measured surface area, not just pool gallons.</p>

  <h3>2. Current Surface Condition</h3>
  <p>A pool with minor surface wear costs less to resurface than one with extensive delamination, deep staining, or multiple structural cracks. Surface prep and crack repair are billed separately in most estimates. Expect $300–$1,500 in crack repair costs for typical Bexar County soil movement damage.</p>

  <h3>3. Tile and Coping</h3>
  <p>If your waterline tile or coping is damaged, cracked, or simply dated, many homeowners choose to replace it during the resurfacing project. Waterline tile replacement typically adds $1,500–$4,000; full coping replacement adds $2,500–$7,000 depending on the material and perimeter length.</p>

  <h3>4. Pool Deck</h3>
  <p>Deck resurfacing is often done simultaneously with pool resurfacing. A Kool Deck overlay adds $2,000–$5,000 for a typical San Antonio pool deck. Decorative stamped overlays run $4,000–$8,000+.</p>

  <h3>5. Contractor Experience and Quality</h3>
  <p>Pool resurfacing is one trade where the quality of the application crew makes an enormous difference in how long the surface lasts. Proper surface prep, correct product ratios, and disciplined startup chemistry — especially with San Antonio's hard water — are what separate a surface that lasts 20 years from one that starts delaminating in 5.</p>

  <h2>Plaster vs. Quartz vs. Pebble: Which Is Right for You?</h2>

  <h3>White Plaster</h3>
  <p>The most affordable option. White plaster (also called marcite) creates a bright, clean pool look. In San Antonio, we recommend plaster for pools that are older (30+ years) where a full shell assessment is needed before committing to a premium finish, or for homeowners planning to sell within 5–7 years. Plaster requires more diligent water chemistry management — calcium hardness, pH, and total alkalinity must be carefully maintained to prevent accelerated scaling.</p>

  <h3>Quartz Aggregate</h3>
  <p>The best value for most San Antonio homeowners. Quartz finishes like Diamond Brite and QuartzScapes are significantly harder and more scale-resistant than plaster. They last 12–18 years in our market and require less intensive water chemistry management. The cost premium over plaster ($1,500–$3,000) is typically recouped in reduced chemical costs and the longer interval between resurfacing projects.</p>

  <h3>Pebble Finish (PebbleTec / PebbleSheen)</h3>
  <p>The premium choice. Pebble aggregate finishes are the most durable surface available for residential pools and are an especially wise investment in San Antonio given our hard water. They last 15–25 years with proper care, are naturally slip-resistant, and create a beautiful natural appearance. The higher upfront cost is offset by a significantly longer replacement cycle — you may only resurface with pebble twice in the life of a pool versus 3–4 times with plaster.</p>

  <h2>How to Get the Best Price on Pool Resurfacing</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Get 3 quotes:</strong> Compare itemized quotes from licensed contractors. Be wary of quotes that are unusually low — surface prep shortcuts lead to premature failures.</li>
    <li><strong>Time it off-season:</strong> Fall and winter resurfacing (October–February) often allows for more scheduling flexibility and sometimes better pricing.</li>
    <li><strong>Bundle with tile and coping:</strong> If your tile needs work anyway, doing it during a resurfacing project saves on mobilization costs versus doing it as a separate job.</li>
    <li><strong>Verify TDLR licensing:</strong> Texas requires all pool contractors to be licensed through the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Always verify before signing a contract — unlicensed work can void homeowner's insurance.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask about the startup process:</strong> Proper startup chemistry during the first 7–10 days is critical to surface longevity. Ask every bidding contractor how they handle startup, especially for San Antonio's hard water.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="faq-block">
    <h3>How do I know if I need resurfacing or just a cleaning?</h3>
    <p>Surface stains that respond to brushing and chemical treatment are a cleaning issue. Rough patches that feel like sandpaper, visible plaster delamination (sections peeling away from the shell), cracks in the surface, and staining that doesn't respond to acid washing all indicate it's time to resurface. A free on-site assessment from a licensed contractor will give you a definitive answer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-block">
    <h3>Does pool resurfacing increase home value in San Antonio?</h3>
    <p>Yes — a freshly resurfaced pool with updated tile is a strong selling point in San Antonio's competitive real estate market. Most real estate professionals estimate that a pool in excellent condition adds $15,000–$25,000 to home value in Bexar County. A resurfacing project costing $5,000–$8,000 typically generates a strong return when the home sells.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-block">
    <h3>How long will I be without my pool during resurfacing?</h3>
    <p>Most San Antonio pool resurfacing projects take 7–10 days from drain to swim-ready. Surface preparation and crack repair take 1–2 days, finish application takes 1 day, and the startup chemistry and curing process takes 5–7 days. We schedule projects to minimize lost swim season whenever possible — fall through early spring is the best time to resurface without sacrificing summer pool time.</p>
