      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">How much does pool resurfacing cost in San Antonio? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Pool resurfacing in San Antonio typically ranges from $4,500 for basic white plaster to $12,000+ for full renovations with premium pebble finishes. The final cost depends on your pool's size, current condition, chosen finish material, and whether any structural repairs are needed. We provide free on-site estimates so you get an accurate price — not a guess. Visit our <a href="services.html" style="color:var(--terracotta)">services page</a> for a full pricing guide.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">How long does pool resurfacing take? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Most pool resurfacing projects take 5–10 days from start to swim day. Basic plaster jobs can be completed in 5–7 days, while pebble and quartz finishes take 7–10 days. Full renovations that include tile, coping, and structural work can take 2–3 weeks. Weather can affect timing — San Antonio's summer heat actually helps cure surfaces faster, so spring and summer are ideal.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">What's the best pool finish for San Antonio's climate? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">For San Antonio's extreme heat and UV exposure, we recommend pebble finishes (PebbleTec or PebbleSheen) for maximum durability — they last 15–20 years. Quartz finishes are an excellent mid-range option with great UV resistance and a 10-year lifespan. Standard plaster works well for budget-conscious homeowners but typically needs resurfacing every 7–10 years due to our intense sun exposure.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">Does San Antonio's limestone soil affect my pool? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Yes — this is one of the most common issues we see. San Antonio sits on limestone and caliche soil that expands and contracts with moisture changes. During drought cycles (common in Texas summers), the soil can shift enough to crack pool shells. Before any resurfacing, we perform a thorough structural assessment to identify and repair soil-related damage. Ignoring these cracks and simply resurfacing over them will lead to the same problems within a year or two.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">How do I know my pool needs resurfacing? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Common signs include: rough or sandpaper-like texture, visible staining that won't respond to chemical treatment, surface flaking or peeling (delamination), cracks or spider-webbing, difficulty maintaining water chemistry, and chalky residue on the surface. If your pool is over 8–10 years old and you're noticing any of these, it's time for an assessment. We offer free inspections — <a href="contact.html" style="color:var(--terracotta)">contact us</a> to schedule yours.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">Do you offer financing? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Yes, we offer flexible financing options through our lending partners. Qualified homeowners can get 0% interest for 12 months or low monthly payments spread over 3–5 years. We'll walk you through the options during your free estimate so you can choose what works best for your budget.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">What areas do you serve? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">We serve San Antonio and all surrounding communities within a 40-mile radius. This includes Alamo Heights, Stone Oak, Helotes, Boerne, Schertz, New Braunfels, Converse, Live Oak, Terrell Hills, Shavano Park, Fair Oaks Ranch, and the greater Hill Country area. If you're not sure whether you're in our service area, give us a call at <a href="tel:2105550199" style="color:var(--terracotta)">(210) 555-0199</a>.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">Can I swim during the resurfacing process? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">No — the pool must be drained during surface preparation and application. After the new finish is applied, the pool is filled with water and needs 7–10 days to cure properly. During curing, we visit multiple times to brush the surface and balance water chemistry. Once curing is complete, you're clear to swim! We know it's tough waiting during a San Antonio summer, but the curing process is critical for a long-lasting finish.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">What warranty do you offer? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Our warranties vary by finish type: plaster and marcite come with a 5-year workmanship warranty, quartz finishes get a 10-year warranty, and pebble finishes include a 10–15 year warranty. Structural repairs carry a 3-year warranty. All warranties cover material defects and workmanship — if something fails due to our work, we fix it at no cost.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">When is the best time to resurface a pool in San Antonio? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">The ideal time is late winter through early spring (February–April). This gets your pool ready before the summer swimming season, and the warm-but-not-extreme temperatures are perfect for curing. Fall (September–November) is also excellent. We do work year-round, but summer projects require extra care during the curing process due to the extreme heat, and demand is highest so lead times can be longer. Booking in the off-season often means faster scheduling and occasional seasonal discounts.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">Do you use subcontractors? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Never. Every crew member is a full-time Alamo Pool Resurfacing employee, trained in-house and certified in the latest techniques. We believe quality control starts with who's doing the work. Our 24 craftsmen have an average tenure of 8 years with the company — they take pride in every pool they touch because their name is on it.</div></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item reveal">
        <div class="faq-question">What happens if it rains during my resurfacing? <span class="icon">+</span></div>
        <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Light rain during the curing phase is actually beneficial — it helps keep the surface moist. However, heavy rain during the application phase can be problematic. We monitor weather forecasts closely and schedule application days accordingly. If unexpected weather hits during a critical stage, we take protective measures and adjust the timeline. San Antonio's climate is generally cooperative, but we're always prepared for surprises.</div></div>
